# Raspberry-pico-projects

The files in this respitory are for simple projects for the Raspberry Pi Pico. A cheaper and smaller version of the Raspberry PI. It is a good alternative for the tradional Raspberry Pi to learn python, hardware/software interaction, and simple electronics. 

In order to do these projects, make sure you have a Pico Display unit, Raspberry Pi usb cable(most likely comes with it when you buy the PICO), a micropython intrepter and a few electronic trinkets(wires, diodes, and a breadboard(isn't necessary but can be useful)). 

Thonny is a useful and simple python intrepter useful for programming PICOs.
