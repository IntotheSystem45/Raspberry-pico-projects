# Raspberry-pico-projects

#This files in this respitory are for simple projects for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

#In order to do thes projects, make sure you have a Pico Display unit, Raspberry Pi usb cable(most likely comes with it when you buy the PICO), and a few electronic trinkets(wires, diodes, and a breadboard(isn't necessary but can be useful)).
